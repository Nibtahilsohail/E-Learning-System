 **🎓 E-Learning Management System **

A fully interactive **E-Learning Management System** built in **C++** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This console-based application enables instructors and students to manage courses, assignments, quizzes, materials, and grading—simulating a real-world academic platform.

** 🧠 Object-Oriented Concepts Used**

- **Abstraction**: Abstract `User` base class with virtual functions.
  
- **Encapsulation**: Proper access control using private/protected members.
  
- **Inheritance**: `Student` and `Instructor` classes inherit from the `User` class.
  
- **Polymorphism**: Implemented using virtual methods and function overriding.
  
- **Composition**: Courses are composed of materials, quizzes, and assignments
  
- **Friend Functions/Classes**: Used to allow instructors access to student submissions and marks
  
- **STL Containers**: Extensive use of `vector`, `map`, and `string` for data storage and logic
